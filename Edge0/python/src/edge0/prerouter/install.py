"""Install prerouter heads into a loaded base model.

Two conventions exist (both supported here):

* qwen (``patch_call=True``): heads are NEW ``PrerouterHead`` modules
  attached to the MoE blocks, and the MoE block's ``__call__`` is patched
  at class level so decode routes through the prerouter's
  ``pred_inds``/``pred_scores`` (100% replacement, no matching/drops).
  Prefill is untouched (router path).  The patch mirrors the deployment's
  proven ``_trained_call``, with guards per instance so non-prerouter
  engines keep the normal router.
* ling (``patch_call=False``): the vendored model already contains one
  ``BailingPrerouter`` per MoE layer and consumes ``prerouter_cache``
  logits internally; this installer only fills the head weights (and
  zeroes ``linear_init`` when the checkpoint has none).
