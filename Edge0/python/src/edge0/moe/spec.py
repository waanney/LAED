"""MoE abstraction: routing kinds, quantized weight layouts, and the spec

Every MoE block in a supported model is described by one ``MoESpec``; the
streaming subsystem consumes the spec (layout + key template) so one
generic ``StreamingSwitchGLU`` serves all models.

            the math derives sizes from the weight tensors).
        router: routing math family.
        norm_topk_prob: renormalize selection weights.
        routed_scaling: multiplier applied to selection weights
            (sigmoid-group routers); None for softmax-topk.
        n_group / topk_group: group-limited routing parameters

        shared_experts: number of resident shared experts (never streamed).
        quant: weight quantization.
