"""Attention taxonomy.

edge0 does not re-implement attention kernels: the vendored base model
implementations (``edge0.backends.mlx._impl``) carry the kernels (GQA /
GatedDeltaNet for edge0-35b, MLA / DeltaNet for edge0-8b).  This module
describes attention so the framework can introspect a model — cache
sizing, layer roles, documentation, and future kernels — without knowing
the concrete implementation.

A new attention kind = a new ``AttentionKind`` member + an
``AttentionSpec`` description + a kernel implementation (in a vendored
base or a backend ``_impl`` module).  See docs/attention.md.
